# jsdoc4readme

**Generate an API section for a README.md from inline JSDocs**

_What? Surely there's other ways to do this already?_ Yes! But I have opinions!

See https://github.com/rvagg/iamap/#api for an example of the generated Markdown from jsdoc4readme.

## Related works

Some related works, along with my rationale for not choosing them for my own use. Follow the links and you may find something that works for you:

* [jsdoc](https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc) - this is used internally by jsdoc4readme, it's designed for producing HTML or a structured output. It doesn't have a Markdown generator (nor an external API). I don't want HTML.
* [jsdoc-to-markdown](https://github.com/jsdoc2md/jsdoc-to-markdown) - works well but overly complex if you have opinions about formatting that deviate too much (plus I experienced some bugs).
* [documentationjs](https://github.com/documentationjs/documentation) - `npm install documentation` â‡’ `added 631 packages from 624 contributors`. Nope nope nope. I'm a simple man with simple needs and _hate_ bloated dependency trees. I also don't like the Markdown formatting.
* [gendo](https://github.com/thlorenz/gendo) - relies on documentationjs and also sets up `gh-pages` for a web version in addition to README editing.

## Install

```sh
npm install jsdoc4readme
```

`-g` to install as a global tool, `-D` to save to a package.json's `devDependencies`.

## Usage

```sh
jsdoc4readme [--readme] <sourcefile>[, <sourcefile>, ...]
```

The `--readme` argument will look for a README.md (or README.markdown, or a case insensitive variant) and replace the block between an `## API` line and the next `##` heading. If you don't supply `--readme`, the Markdown will be printed to standard out and you can do what you like with it.

Add a script to package.json for use as `npm run docs` (after installing with `npm install jsdoc4readme -D`):

```json
  "scripts": {
    "docs": "jsdoc4readme --readme *.js"
  }
```
